# Requiem

Requiem is a mod aiming at revamping Minecraft’s death system and the gameplay surrounding it.
In the base game, death presents itself as the simple threat of losing your items, setting you back proportionally to how much stuff you carried.

With this mod installed however, every player can choose an alternate path where death leads to a completely different gameplay sequence where they play as an actual ghost with the goal of finding a replacement body. Further down the line, players can learn to harness their otherworldly powers, perfecting the dark art of body possession, and unlocking special tech to assist them.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Upon dying for the first time in a world, a dialogue will be prompted to the player. In this menu, the player can select whether or not they want to become a demon, and activate the mod for themselves or not. After choosing, the player obtains the “A Devilish Conundrum” and the dialogue will not be prompted anymore. However, the player can still change their mind by using the Mortician’s conversion trade at a later time.
